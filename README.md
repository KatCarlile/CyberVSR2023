# CyberVSR2023
This repo contains artifacts from my participation in RIT CyberVSR2023. Create_CrossVul_JS file creates a dataset for the project containing just javascript files from the CrossVul dataset. GPT_Playground is where ChatGPT evaluates the remaining JS files for weaknesses. 

To use, pull the CrossVul_JS repo from https://github.com/KatCarlile/CrossVul_JS and place it at a usable file-path (I used Google Drive - if you don't, you can forego the drive mount code in GPT_Playground). Adjust to your filepath in GPT-playground and use your own openai api key.
